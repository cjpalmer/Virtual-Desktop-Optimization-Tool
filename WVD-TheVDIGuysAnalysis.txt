AppxPackages.json
	Performs the following tasks for each item:
		Remove-AppxPackage
			This removes the current installation
		Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage
			This will prevent it reinstalling for each new user
	Removes the following:
		Microsoft.OneConnect
		Microsoft.MSPaint - Do we need to keep this or should we publish this as a RemoteApp?
		Microsoft.BingWeather
		Microsoft.GetHelp
		Microsoft.GetStarted
		Microsoft.Messaging
		Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub - Will this break anything of ours?
		Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection - Oh, this is critical to keep...
		Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes - Do some of our users use this?
		Microsoft.Office.OneNote - I think this one probably needs to stay
		Microsoft.People
		Microsoft.Print3D
		Microsoft.SkypeApp - Does this affect Teams in anyway?
		Microsoft.Wallet
		Microsoft.Windows.Photos - Do we need this for our users to look at anything?
		Microsoft.WindowsAlarms

		Microsoft.ScreenSketch - What about this?
		Microsoft.MixedReality.Portal
		Microsoft.Microsoft3DViewer
			This is actually listed twice but named Microsoft.OneConnect at the bottom of the file.
ISSUE: AppxPackages.json. Duplicate Entry for Microsoft.OneConnect which seems to have guts of Microsoft.Microsoft3DViewer

AutoLoggers.json
	Performs the following for each entry in file:
		New-ItemProperty and sets Start to 0 which effectively disables the task from running
	I don't see anything that I am concerned about in this one. Primarily is it disabling diagnostics for Wifi and Phone related features.

DefaultUserSettings.txt
	This is mounting the NTUSER.DAT in the C:\Users\Default folder and then customizing some settings
	It then runs each line predicated with C:\Windows\System32\Reg.exe
	It is setting some default Explorer states and settings (disabling some stuff and enabling others)
	Also minimizing graphically rich screens to optimize the fact this is RDP (reducing memory and processor footprint to maximize users on a host)
	It disables automatic background running for some unnecessarily chatty items?
	Sets the last setting three times... Typo cleanup
		Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\UserProfileEngagement" /v ScoobeSystemSettingEnabled
			UserProfileEngagement folder doesn't exist to create the key in... and it is trying to do it three times
ISSUE: DefaultUserSettings.txt has the same entry 3 times:
ISSUE: add "HKLM\Temp\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\UserProfileEngagement" /v ScoobeSystemSettingEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
ISSUE: While I agree this is a good setting to set in the Default user profile, I am wondering why it is doing it three times

REQUEST:
Add the following to DefaultUserSettings.txt to make Explorer default to This PC instead of Quick Access:
add "HKLM\Temp\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced" /v LaunchTo /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f


ScheduledTasks.json
	Disables scheduled tasks that normally run by default
	Performs the following for each entry:
		Disable-ScheduledTask
	Disables a bunch of Customer Experience reporting as well as background maintenance that isn't really necessary in a VDI environment

Services.json
	Disables services that are not useful in a VDI environment
	Performs the following on the services listed:
		Stop-Service -Force
		Set-Service -StartupType Disabled
	CaptureService - screen capture for Windows.Graphics.Capture API?

LGPO settings
	There are two Registry.POL files (one for User and one for Machine)
	Uses LGPO.exe to import the User and Computer registry.pol file into the local group policy store
	You can review the settings with SDM Registry Policy Viewer


Additional items done in the main script:
	Sets following keys in HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\
		DisableBandwidthThrottling - DWord 1
		FileInfoCacheEntriesMax - DWord 1024
		DirectoryCacheEntriesMax - DWord 1024
		FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax - DWord 1024
		DormantFileLimit - Dword 256
	Sets the 'Send Buffer Size' for the adapter to 4MB
		Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -DisplayName "Send Buffer Size" -DisplayValue 4MB
	Cleans up various file types anywhere on the disk:
		*.tmp, *.dmp, *.etl, *.evtx, thumbcache*.db, *.log
	Cleans up the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\RetailDemo folder
		Exists on my machine but is just empty directories
	Cleans up C:\Windows\Temp of files not in use
	Cleans up Windows Error Reporting files from ProgramData
	Cleans up %TEMP% ($env:TEMP) of any files that are not in use
	Runs Clear-RecycleBin to empty the recycle bins
	Runs Clear-BCCache to clear the BranchCache cache
	NOTE: Doesn't run the Disk Cleanup Wizard because it has been deprecated
	Prompts for a reboot

On test VM, I downloaded and edited for the two issues above and then ran it as default otherwise.
Got an error when trying to set Start = 0 for HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\RadioMgr\
	Error:
New-ItemProperty : Requested registry access is not allowed.
At C:\Windows_10_VDI_Optimize\Win10_VirtualDesktop_Optimize.ps1:158 char:9   
	Checked the registry path and there is a Start key with a value of 1 already. I don't know if that was there already and that is why it failed or not
		I was unable to change the value through the GUI as well
